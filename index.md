# Hello!<a href=""><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="6%"></a>

My name is **Miguel Ferreira** and I'm a *Data Scientist* *web/destkop developer* from Brazil, especialized in CRISP-DM data science methodology and predictive Machine Learning in time series.

I hold the **IBM Data Scientist certificate** (*Coursera*) and other several professional certificates from *Udemy*, *Unimed* (network of hospitals) and *Digital Innovation One* (online tech profissionalization network) in several different tech areas as **Data Science, Machine Learning, Databases** and **MERN web/desktop development**. I'm proficient in tasks that envolves:    

  - **CRISP-DM Data Science Methodology** :bar_chart:
  - **Python frameworks for web/desktop development** :clipboard:
  - **Version control** :octocat:
  - **Deploy and hosting** :beers:

My most important tool is my capability *to link different fields of knowledge on approaching the problem to be solved*.

When I'm not being a computer nerd, I like reading old books (the older the better), playing chess, swimming, going in the youth meeting at church and studying so many mysticism that I feel I'm becoming a wizard...

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
